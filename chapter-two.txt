Chapter Two

Notes/Elements:

    <main></main> is used to present the content on a web page that is unique to that page and will not be found elsewhere. This will typically be found below the <header> and <nav> elements, and, typically, there should not be more than one <main> element per page and shouldn't be used as a descendent child element of othe semantic HTML.

    <section></section> is used to section an element or group of elements. For instance, if you have a hierarchical structured page of <h1>-<h6>, and in that structure you have multiple <h3> elements. You could wrap each <h3> element in a <section>. <section> elements aren't to be used to styling purposes, only for generic sectioning of natural headings. If the content doens't have headings and you need something for styling, opt for a <div>.

    <nav></nav> is used for navigational links to other pages or different parts of the same page. 

    <article></article> is used for wrapping self-contained content on a page. The content within an article should make sense if it were moved to a completely different page with no context. Consider how a web search works. Each result in a web search is an <article>. The difference between <article> and <section> is that <article> elements are for stand-alone content.

    <aside></aside> is used to section elements of content that is tangentially related but considered separate from the content. Examples could includes natigation elements, pull quotes, advertising, and sidebars.

    <header></header> is the header of a web page. It can be used elsewhere in the web page, such as in each <article> of a page as well. Note that <header> elements aren't part of the outline algorithm of a web page. 

    <footer></footer> is used as the footer of a web page. You can have multiple <footer> elements on a page, but note that they aren't part of the outline algorithm of a page. 

    <hgroup></hgroup> is used when a group of elements have headings and subheadings within the overall section of a web page. For instance, if you have an <h2> heading and a subheading, the subheading should not be <h3>, rather, it should be a <p> and both elements should be wrapped in a <hgroup> element. <p> elements can come before or after the heading element.

    <div></div> has no semantic value and should only used for wrapping elements that need styling. Only use <div> when you have no other options. 

    <p></p> is used for paragraphs and specific text.

    <blockquote></blockquote> is used for citing information from an outside source. It can have a <p> element within, but does not have to. Attribution of the quoted text should be done outside of the <blockquote>.

    <figure></figure> is used for self-contained elements, not necessarily independent elements. Self-contained in this context means independent within some flow of content. For instance, if you were writing an article or blog post and put a picture of the subject of the post somewhere within the post but are not using it specifically for the subject of the post, you would wrap the <img> in a <figure> element and include a <figcaption> for semantic purposes to help assistive technologies. Compare that to when you are using an <img> within a sentence, perhaps within a <blockquote>, you would not use a <figure> element because the <img> is the subject of the content itself. 

    <details></details> is used to create drop down widgets. Within <details> you should have a <summary> element that will tell the user something, perhaps what the drop down is about, and then a <p> or some other element to actually show upon clicking the drop down. These are really useful for FAQ pages but need a bit of CSS to not look like absolute trash.

    <address></address> is used for providing contact information, not phsyical address information. Basically, just use this for providing email addresses and phone numbers. 

    <span></span> is the in-line, text-level equivalent of <div>. If you want to style some specific text within a <p>, for instance, you can use a <span> to style to text without moving all of the following text to a new line.     

    <strong></strong> is an in-line element that is used to emphasize strength, urgency, or importance. 

    <em></em> is an in-line element that is used to emphasize something within text.

    <i></i> is an in-line element used in a span of text to convey an alternative voice or mood.

    <video></video> is used to insert videos into a web page. The syntax for video will be something like this: <video src="my-video.mp4"</video> and you can also give height, width, control attributes, and a variety of other attributes. If you have multiple source types of video format, you can use the <source> element within the <video> element. Place it after the other attributes and put the src link within the <source>. A problem you'll run into with <video> is dealing with the aspect ratio of the video. Some CSS will need to be used here. For embedding videos, http://embedresponsively.com/ can be useful.
    
    <audio></audio> is basically the same as <video> other than having a few different attributes.

    <dialog></dialog> is used to create dialog boxes on a web page.
